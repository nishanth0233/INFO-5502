For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets. Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/unt-iialab/info5502-spring2022/tree/main/datasets/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis. Please build a logistic regression model for the classification, evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score need to be reported. "
