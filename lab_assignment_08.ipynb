The data used in this lab assignment will contain salary data and other statistics for basketball players from the 2014-2015 NBA season. This data was collected from the following sports analytic sites: [Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) and [Spotrac](http://www.spotrac.com). The dataset of this assignment can be downloaded from github: https://github.com/unt-iialab/info5502-spring2022/tree/main/datasets/lab-assignment-8\n",
